Error Handling: Add proper error handling in your code. For example, when loading the dataset from the JSON file, you can handle cases where the file is not found or the JSON data is not in the expected format.

Modularity: Consider organizing your code into reusable functions and modules. This can make your code more maintainable and scalable.

User Input Validation: Implement input validation to ensure that the user's query and response are valid and meet any required criteria. This can prevent unexpected behavior or errors.

User Experience: Enhance the user experience by providing clear instructions and feedback, such as displaying error messages or success notifications.

Code Optimization: Look for opportunities to optimize your code for better performance. For example, you can avoid unnecessary loops or repetitive operations.

Remember that the "best level" of code can vary depending on specific requirements and context. It's always a good practice to continuously improve and refine your code based on feedback and user needs.
